#  Effective Tracking of Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE)

## Company  
**Deeksha Exports Pvt. Ltd.**  

## Industry Type  
Manufacturing and Export  

##  Internship Duration  
**May 2025 – July 2025 (2 Months)**  

---

##  Key Metrics (Mar–Jun 2025, 4 Months)  
- **Availability:** 79.62%  
- **Performance:** 84.08%  
- **Quality:** 99.69%  
- **Overall OEE:** 66.74% *(below benchmark of 85%)*  

---

##  Observations  
-  Consistently **high quality**, but efficiency dragged by downtime.  
-  **VMC series machines** are most breakdown-prone.  
-  OEE trend fluctuated, with lowest dip in **May (41%)**.  

---

## Highlights  
-  **Top Machines:** Chromating & Vacuum M/c (**87.5% OEE**)  
-  **Low Performing:** CNC 1 M/c (**62.63% OEE**)  
-  **Major Downtime:** VMC 9 M/c (**12.12K mins**)  
-  **Highest Rejections:** Small RV Housing (**485 units**)  

---

##  Recommendations  
-  Implement **Predictive Maintenance** on critical VMCs.  
-  Train operators on **downtime reduction & quick changeovers**.  
-  Use **real-time dashboards** for daily OEE monitoring.  
-  Conduct **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** for Small RV Housing rejections.  

---

##  Tech Stack / Tools Used  
- **Tally ERP** → Data extraction (production & breakdown reports)  
- **Microsoft Excel** → Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- **Power BI** → Dashboard creation, visualization, and trend analysis  
- **Statistical Analysis** → OEE calculations (Availability × Performance × Quality)  

---

##  About the Project  
This project focused on **tracking and improving Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE)** using **Tally exports and Power BI dashboards**.  
The study identified downtime hotspots, rejection trends, and improvement opportunities.  
The proposed solutions aim to bring OEE closer to the **world-class benchmark of 85%**.
